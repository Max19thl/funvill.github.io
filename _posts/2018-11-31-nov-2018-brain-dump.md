## Books 

- [The Phoenix Project: A Novel about IT, DevOps, and Helping Your Business Win](https://www.amazon.ca/Phoenix-Project-DevOps-Helping-Business/dp/0988262592) - This book has been recomended to me a few times my other teamleaders that found it useful. 
- [Plum Island by Nelson DeMille] - A hard boiled detective novel that followed a NYPD detective John Corey in 1997 as he a murder. Great book and started the John Corey series of books. I just started the [The Lion's Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lion%27s_Game), book 2 of 7 in this series. 
- [Sabrina by Nick Drnaso](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/177046316X/) - The first ever graphic novel nominated for [the man booker](https://themanbookerprize.com/) prize. This is a great review of the book from Just Write](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yuyu1y1m1s4)
